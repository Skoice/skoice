# Skoice
Skoice is initially a technical demonstration of the possibility to create a proximity voice chat on Minecraft using Discord (instead of Mumble, much used for that).

I decided to make it public, having had many requests. Skoice is currently in pre-release, so it may have some stability issues. A more complete and stable version will come in the next months.

## What Skoice allows?

Skoice allows players on a Minecraft server to communicate with each other by voice depending on their position in the game. They will be able to talk with players nearby, but not with those far away.

The whole thing works with Discord, players just need to join the dedicated Discord voice channel to access the proximity voice chat!

## How to install Skoice?

The installation is quite different from a classic plugin, because you also have to do some steps on Discord. A complete installation guide is available:

If you encounter any problems during the installation, I can help you on the official Skoice Discord server:
